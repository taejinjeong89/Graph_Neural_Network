This account used extensive edit summaries form the outset	 was at RFPP within 24 hours of registering	 asking for unprotection of 	 voted at MONGO's RfA within 48 hours of registering.  The contributions show that this is a Truther with detailed knowledge of Wikipedia policy and editing procedures	 and is very obviously not a new user.  That	 combined with RFPP and RFA input	 indicates an invalid use of an alternate account.  In addition	 the RFA comment was blatant trolling	 suggesting that supporting the mainstream in 9/11 articles equates to unfitness for adminship.  MONGO's rudeness is a legitimate source of complaint	 his defence of 9/11 articles against rampant POV-pushing is widely admired and is undoubtedly not a problem for the encyclopaedia - quite the opposite.  It is	 however	 a source of relentless trolling of MONGO	 and this account is just one more data point there.  Finally	 the user never requested unblock.  We typically do not honour unblock requests made on Wikipedia Review; no unblock request was made on Wikipedia in respect of this account.  If user:Krimpet wants this account unblocked he can ask on Wikipedia or advise the user to request unblock	 but I don't think we need Truthers crusading against NPOV.  This user very obviously has another account	 they can go back to it (unless	 of course	 it's already blocked). My thanks to Viridae for causing me anger and stress at a bad time. Guy ()

0	Several exting quaternary volcanoes are situated in the surroundings of the town Bruntál. Most of them belong to the group of mixed volcanoes	 which means that the activity of the volcanoes was in turns explosive and extrusive. Lava was vomited during the surface in the shape of incoherent volvano eruptive rock. On the contrary by the extrusion lava was running out from the crater and formed the lava streams. The volcano eruptive rocks form mostly the volcano maar.

And the absence of Hebrews in Egypt except in the 12th and 13th Dynasties seems to be no problem for the folks conduncting the reasoning. Neither the Hyksos period nor the following dynasties (18+19) had any relevant numbers of Aamu dwelling in Egypt (and the Hyksos elite themselves were mainly Indo-Europeans and not Semites).

0	I thought Wikipedia had a policy for this called Ignore All Rules.  Apparently	 however	 it is just a decoration.  Simple reason it has fallen into disfavor is that it really doesn't find use for maintenance staff who rely on conventional practice.  It will mainly find use for article writers who have an aim towards improving an article and dislike bureaucratic hairsplitting getting in the way of making an article better.  Unfortunately there are too many maintenance staff kind of editors especially among admins and less and less of the fundamental article improvement variety. IAR is dead.

0	I think we clearly agree more than we disagree. Just to clarify my point	 though	 I feel that	 for the very reason that we	 indeed	 do not want to speak authoritatively on a single proven cause	 this is more than just saying explicitly up front that there are multiple theories. Whether our audience includes those touched by the affliction	 or also those from the general public who want to learn more	 we owe it to them not to give undue weight to observations that exist as isolated anecdotes in the literature	 even the academically peer-reviewed literature. The academic peer-reviewed literature includes multiple review articles	 and it would be better to shorten the page by largely deleting material that is not cited there.

0	I'm not a physicist	 so don't kill me. Why isn't Bell's theorem discussed? Bell's theorem puts a big hole in hidden variable theories (stating that no local hidden variable theory can exist). One would have to make a serious jump to non-local hidden variable theories in order to have ANY hidden variable theory. Am I right in saying that there's no evidence or theoretical proof that says information can move faster than the speed of light? How could one even consider hidden variable theories without making that jump to assume information can move faster than the speed of light? Even if the speed of light is beatable	 how would we prove it? The bias in the physics section is leaning towards is determinism because it says hidden variable theories could happen	 it doesn't mention Bell's theorem	 AND it makes a terrible counter-argument to hidden variable theories using that number genorator nonsense. As Gibbzmann said	 this seems to put hidden variable deterministic theories on par with indeterministic theories by having Bell's theorem absent. Determinism and hidden variable theories may make people happy	 but Bell's theorem says otherwise on the topic of local hidden variable theories. As Gibbzmann said	 science has no grace with personal tastes. (  )

0	The Fayetteville metro is sometimes included as a part of the region and has a population of 2	041	000 when added. Students of land use and regional planning have recently begun to refer to the area as the Cinco Circle referencing the elliptical shape of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill-Carrboro-Cary area. The use of the word cinco	 meaning 5 in Spanish	 also reflects the recent substantial increase in the Latino population in the Raleigh-Durham area. Between 1990 and 2004	 North Carolina saw its Latino population grow from 76	000 to nearly 600	000. From the school years 2000-2001 to 2004-2005	 Latino students accounted for 57.3 percent of the total growth in the North Carolina public schools	 resulting in a change in school enrollment of 45	148 students.[1] WHAT???

On his website he writes very negatively about Jewish people. With a vim and vigor that would lead one to beleive he does not like people of the jewish faith. His poem Jimi Hendrix was a field hand has some very strong language that is derrogatory to Jimi Hendrix and other Africna Americans. I can't make this up.

0	Haha. I guess it would be fun to look at. Unfortunately	 it's not quite as fun to take part in. I have asked for another look by a checkuser because all I need to know if it's the same person—if it is	 that's all I need to know because it is automatically considered to be abusive as long as there's block evasion or something similar. No need for you to bother now	 but I'm still worried about what I should do next because I don't want to get into an edit war over something I've just spent hours discussing.

0	I have posted a note on Administrator ItsZippy's talk page asking for help with a disruptive editor. I realized yesterday that Mrm7171 meets the criterion in that he is intimidating other editors	 making them reluctant to contribute to the article because he/she will undo their work	 and then engage in a long aggressive argument that generates walls and walls of text on the talk page	 yet fails to accomplish anything productive. It has taken me four months to add 4-5 sentences	 and each one was a protracted battle with this one editor. I have had no problems with any other editor	 even when we had different apparent backgrounds and perspectives.

0	I don't know what you want me to say to them. They seem pretty determined to drag both our names through the mud in their zeal to defend that ass SPUI. Doesn't shock me. From the day I first interacted with him the guy has had his own little bodyguard squad of admins protecting him just because he's made 50k worth of edits	 most of them being page moves and redirects however so I don't see what they think he's added to the project. But I will try for what it's worth. As for stalking you	 there is nothing in the rules I've seen that says I can't track your user contribs or SPUIs or Rschen's like I do. I use them as a kind of watch page. If someone would like to point me to where that is wrong	 then please do so	 otherwise I'll continue to do so as I please.
0	Please note:  you should not removed tags such as  from your article until the issue is resolved	 as you did with the aforementioned article.  However	 if you disagree with it	 you can add  to your page	 which will allow the admin to review your explanation for why it should not be speedily deleted.

0	Maybe I wasn't clear: legitimate criticism of a POV administrator is valid. Don't vandalize my edits and don't threaten me.
0	Please do not replace Wikipedia pages with blank content	 as you did to Balance sheet. Blank pages are harmful to Wikipedia because they have a tendency to confuse readers.

Still	 I agree with your idea more or less	 as you have said that the meaning of Tsushima Island equates with 対馬島.

0	If you trying to be correct then politically the article should remain Republic of China it doesn't matter if it's commonly refered as Taiwan. People can read why Republic of China is on Taiwan and the political status. This is one of the few article that is very politically and socially sensitive as your mere title change is supporting Taiwanese independence which the People's Republic of China doesn't approve of and while the Republic of China can't do much to Wikipedia they can. Tell me how many people around the globe can read and understand English? Many. Even stating 'Taiwan is a country' is politically incorrect as switching Republic of China with Taiwan is supporting Taiwanese independence and Taiwan is not a country. Please read the articles of Taiwanese independence	 Taiwan's political status	 One-China Policy	 foreign relations of the Republic of China.

0	To clarify: the article is now 5569 words	 which under FAC glare is too much for any one editor to polish. You have done an amazing job copy editing	 repairing and adding to the article so far	 and note that no serious objection has been made on prose style; just on incidences of text recently added before you had got there first. (You might be relieved to hear I discovered Firefox yesterday	 which as a built in spell-checker. Finally!) Anyway	 I don't expect you to cover flow	 repair	 polish and style all in one bag. The style I like most for wiki is what Outriggr gave to Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion	 the bastard has left me at the alter	 though your work is bring it closer and closer to there.

0	My suggestion is that either you find a peer-reviewed journal article to back the methods of falsifiability that you have listed or you delete the section about falsifiability. I have been following the WIKI guidance of dicussiong these changes prior to making changes to the article	 but if you cannot give clear justification and you only delete the discussion	 then it is within my rights to make changes to the article without a discussion. In other words	 I would suggest playing fair. You don't have to follow my suggestion	 but then I don't have to play fair either.

I will just leave it at the following	 people like all of you is why Wikipedia is dying and why there aren't new editors	 and why nobody gives a damn to contribute. I merely started out assisting the citation of the previous content which was not mine	 you people seriously need to learn what constructive editing is	 you've succeeded in turning this into an entire mess	 with the article having less information than it did before any of my edits.

0	It sounds like AussieLegend also thinks we should use proper English in the credits.  I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television.  This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done.  I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof).  This way	 we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately.  Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence	 I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar).  The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.  Clearly	 the first two worked together	 while the last two worked independently of the others.  I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table.  Whenever I type in writers	 I always go with whatever the episode says (of course	 from what I can remember	 I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).  Again	 though	 there is no statement anywhere in policy that I can find that specifies which format should be used.

0	I took your statement to mean unblock requests on this block	 which I don't think is unreasonable. If you meant any past request	 you should have specified. Presumably in there you mean where I called the C of E a liar (I cannot see any other personal attacks	 so if you do	 please be clearer); while not exactly polite	 I provided evidence to back that statement up. As I undestand it	 that is not a personal attack	 it is justifiable in the context of describing an actual inter-personal dispute with another editor which was relevant to the request	 rather than making a dispute about articles needlessly personal (I'm pretty sure WP:NPA doesn't exist to simply force people to say things like 'he spoke a mistruth	 per xyx'). The second example is not an unblock request	 and was clearly part of the same issue	 the ITN discussion.

0	I have long found this reference useful	 but it now seems to be under attack for not conforming to Wikipedia's norms.  I think new content added will struggle to conform to such	 and this reference is far less useful if incomplete.  Hence	 I would advocate for option 4 directly	 before any more gets chopped up and people get frustrated with Wikipedia	 moreover waste their efforts in a futile attempt to satisfy the rules.  Wikipedia doesn't seem to really want this kind of content	 and there are other	 stable Wiki's that do.

A match is played by two teams and you report on both teams in the match. I was thinking of using the templates (See example at 2009–10 Coventry City F.C. season) rather than the table and they give even more detail of each match as we are currently missing things such as cards and referees for the matches.

0	I don't know anyone who has entertained the belief that Bacon had buggered Jonson. As for his servants	 that may be a different matter. Bray suspects that it may have been the money Bacon gave them that brought the matter to notice: certainly	 homosexual relations between masters and servants were clearly common enough to provoke the satirists. As for the weight allotted to it in the article: this is a classic situation in Wikipedia. Any implication of homosexuality in an historical figure has to be detailed and fully referenced beyond normal expectation	 otherwise it is then accused of being an unsupported allegation	 with the resulting endless edit war. In addition	 the earlier point made on this thread about including it: Because a significant amount of modern scholarship is focused on how it affected the development of his ontology is extremely valid. The growth of gay studies departments within universities in recent years	 and the flood of research and interpretation	 is having a significant impact	 and is literally re-writing history. To give a tiny example: the discoveries and interpretations in Crompton's 'Byron and Greek Love' have affected every Byron biography published after 1985. Multiply this a thousand times	 and one gets an idea of the tsunami of change. For the homophobic this presents a confronting situation	 but it's the reality.

Considering most of his life was lived in a German republic I would be more inclined to leave his title out but if somebody else wants to include I wouldn't mind. For me though	 leave it the way it is	 for the sake of convenience as much as anything. I'll look for a reference later on.

0	The demand for sourcing is a bit unrealistic when you can just go to Den'enchōfu and see for yourself. Well	 chances are that you can't but as it happens I can (which means nothing) and thousands of others can too (which does mean something). I do have serious reservations about this article as it was before the latest addition/deletion/reinsertion: it seems to me to recycle stereotypes about Den'enchōfu that are only partly true. (Also	 I'm pretty sure that at least one of the photos isn't of Den'enchōfu	 and the others are uninformative.)
0	I feel like only coloring half isn't telling the whole story. How about a lighter shade of reddish-brown	 e.g. Zinnwaldite as the back? I don't like the idea of highlighting all four in green... can't tell the difference between winners and losers if all the same color-why color at all?. Alternatively	 I like the idea of the top two (those who advance) in a light color. Perhaps we could have the top two in green and then bold the last match (e.g. if Sweden won their last match	 their total in the W column would be bold).

0	The rules against incivility and personal attacks are great in principle	 but it only takes a little bit of misinterpretation for them to be twisted into a weapon against all disagreement.  Witness this case	 where you are penalizing me for saying that Deskana would be an incompetent admin.  I stand by this assertion: he lacks the skills necessary to do the admin job.  I also stand by the assertion that there are others out there who became admins but are likewise incompetent.  To penalize me for even expressing my views is to stifle all debate and turn Wikipedia into a censored environment.  In short	 your reasoning is suspect	 as is your competency.  You were required to rule on an existing block	 not search my Talk page for unrelated material that you can use to justify it.  Calling someone actually or potentially incompetent is a reasoned conclusion	 not a personal attack.  In contrast	 your thin-skinned response is in violation of the spirit of free inquiry that drives Wikipedia.  Since you did not attempt to do your job	 I will once again raise the flag	 in hopes of a more competent admin noticing.  Your services	 however	 will no longer be required	 Jareth.  You can join Nandesuka on my short list of admins who have proven their incompetence.

We certainly have a reasonable expectation that there is a public domain photo of him out there. Heck	 this one might be public domain. You could try emailing the blogger where you found the image rather than just uploading it and slapping a fair use tag on it. He might be able to tell you where it is originally from. Surely	 at some point	 his picture was published prior to 1923	 or any time in a publication whose copyright was not renewed. We have a reasonable expectation of receiving a public domain image and so using this one is impermissible.

0	This is interesting cause i have several books saying the troops started to land only at evening of 22nd and that operation was completed by the early morning of 23rd. Given that the order to go ahead was given on 22nd i would be quite surprised if Finns landed there on 21st. However none of this matters. Agreement quite clearly states that if the war came to Baltic Sea then Finns were allowed to place troops to the island. And what do you know... Nazi Germany was at war and used Baltic sea making it legal under the demilitarization treaty for the Finns move troops there (technically they could have kept troops there the whole time - its not Finnish problem if SU cant understand treaty texts). Also there is no requirement for the Finland to participate into that war in order to allowed to place troops in Åland. Also as it happened Soviet aircraft attacked unsuccessfully the ships headed to Åland (before they got there that is) on 22nd of June. -

In contrast	 you have chosen to hide a very deep page of discussion that show's your history as a contentious	 argumentative and debatable editor.

Who suddenly jumps onto the Wiki just to delete articles?  And after less than one week?

0	Thought I'd come back and add that some members of minorities are so scared of what can happen to them when facing a majority power that they just go along with majority consensus to avoid personal discomfort. It important to understand this since it helps explain why certain Jews in the concentration camps chose to work with the Nazis. In that case Sluffs Law can take the form: whenever a member of a minority throws Godwin's Law at you then you can assume they have a very deep understanding of what you are talking about but don't wish to be put in the uncomfortable position of taking on a larger and more powerful majority.

0	I just wanted to chip in on this	 as I certainly remember an older version of OT for the Apple II series.  I would have played it sometime in the years 1983-6; probably at the earlier end of that range.  The graphics were monochrome	 and hunting was very different and quite difficult for me to get the hang of.  It was a sort of first-person shooter game	 with your (stationary) hunting blind at the bottom of the screen.  At varying intervals	 a game animal would come trotting horizontally across the screenalmost like a phantom	 you remember those early graphics?and you'd hit the fire button to release a cloud of very slow-moving buckshot.  If they intersected just right	 you got the kill.  This rarely worked for me; I remember being delighted when I saw the newer version in middle school.  I've never been able to find a downloadable version.

Our friend Phaedriel is very popular	 and for good reasons. Let's be happy for her. Kirill pretty much IS the MilHist project. One of my greatest disappointments here is I havent been more of a help to him:(. This project is lucky to have them both as admins and contributors and we're lucky to have them as friends and colleagues.  But if you need it	 by all means take a break! You've earned it M8! Also	 if you wish	 now that the Daily Pulp is De-funcked	 I'll be glad to contribute all the reviews I did there to your rev page. They are only collecting cyber dust in my archives	 plus since I helped fight to keep your page I may as well use it	 right?:)So cheer up	 rest and know that you are not alone!

This is documented by anti-GMO people as well as pro-GMO.   GMOs that are resistant to herbicides (like Roundup) do develop resistance	 which leads to an increase in chemical herbicides that are used.  The article says both things.  It is neutral and accurate.

0	As a technical aside	 what currently is included in Western Ukraine was once part of the Austro-Hungarian state. As such	 there is at least a modicum of fact that a part of Ukraine used to belong to Central Europe. Needless to say	 this geographic interpretation must be viewed in conjunction with other geo-political factors. Ukraine is a very new country and comprises parts that have only recently been brought together into one state.

0	Hi Noam	 Aside for WP:COI and WP:SPAM	 the issue is that your agency's notability must first be established before it can be added to Wikipedia articles. Apparently Dan Fegan has met WP:NOTABILITY guidelines	 is the subject of an article here	 and may be linked to other relevant articles. The general advice is to first write an acceptably sourced article	 per WP:RELIABLE	 about Headline Media Management. However	 you're discouraged from doing that for obvious reasons	 and a perfunctory Google search  doesn't reveal reliable objective sources to support the endeavor. 76.248.149.47

0	And	 of course	 Peiser is more than just a social anthropologist.  He's one whose recent research has focused primarily on the social aspects of climate change and is thus at least as qualified to comment on the state of consensus as a historian.  Regarding his study	 it hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed journal	 but the results have appeared in many reliable sources.  In effect	 it should be treated no differently than as if Peiser himself (or any other scientist) had verbally relayed the conclusions directly to a reporter.  Literally tens of thousands of Wiki articles contain such references direct quotes from scientists	 which appear in no other source but through the medium of a reputable reporter.

It looks like a case of disruption due to dumbness rather than trying.  In particular	 I'd call your attention to the incredibly asinine conversation I've had with him regarding Israel Idonije (though the side of in on my page has been reverted as vandalism by a third party) - I feel stupider just having talked to him. It looks to me like most	 if not all	 of his recent NFL edits should be reversed	 but you're the expert!

0	OK. First	 please understand that not every organisation gets a page here. Then read WP:COI which is about conflict of interest (more clearly	 it is about editing concerning you and yours - subjects you are closely involved with). Follow up with WP:RS which is about reliable independent sources. Without these	 your article would stand no chance. These are needed to back up claims to notability - if no-one knows about the organisation	 or no-one has bothered to discuss it or review it	 then it's not time yet for an article here. A lot of people want to use Wikipedia as a springboard to launch their project and get it noticed	 but that's not the way it works. When something is of note (by our standards)	 we'll record it. The work of getting it noticed is yours. RS does not include blogs	 forums	 press releases (including places like PRWire)	 Facebook etc	 websites at blogspot or wordpress	 or wikis (to mention just some of the no-go ones). When/if you think you can make it	 create the new article (taking care not to promote and using neutral wording WP:NPOV) at

0	Ok	 I won't do anything today. I'm so sorry about what I did. However	 I was at Lucas Biespiel's house yesterday	 and added his page over there on his computer (didn't tell him about it). The only reason he didn't know is that he was gone when I did it (music lesson). He just called me and told me that now he can't do anything on wikipedia because it wasn't my account that was blocked	 it was his IP Address. I promise I wont do anything until the block is clear	 just unblock it so he can use wikipedia.

Since I'm not going to do that	 because after talking it over I can see that your intentions are good	 it wouldn't kill you to drop them a line to apologize for your mistake.

0	It was; the Shakespeare question was the one I was not replying to. But to answer your subsequent question	 I care because it shows the development process of the play. Taking this hypothetical Shakespeare scenario	 it would tell us about his writing process	 and perhaps a little of the politics of theatre in his era. Was it delayed because of writer's block? Were elements of the play changed from the way he envisaged/first drew it out because of that? How did it change the theme	 climax	 or emotion of the show? Was it delayed because the people in power (ie. the theatre owners) disagreed with the play he had created (imagine their reaction if it centred around a homosexual relationship back in that day!)? Or was it perhaps the actors who disagreed with the roles they had to take on? Again that leads us into how Shakespeare worked around the writing problems so that the play could	 eventually	 go forwards. Or perhaps he had financial issues and that delayed aspects of production. I am not a fan of Billy Shakespeare	 but I would find any and all of that information to be most interesing. I would counter that it is	 in fact	 essential information for the article.

0	Why too much Brianyoumans? Who decide this is too much and this is the limit - too much or not too much? This is I think a capitulation form WP in front of NPOV User there	 because only this users see this as hostile	 but what is with the thousands of Serbs who life there with their neighbours	 not only in Vukovar? Is this not hostile when they have no vocie because of NPOV users on WP? You think Vukovar is the end? No. So if you think this is too much brother	 than we must remove also the Hungarina and other langauges from the Infobox in Subotica	 Srbobran ect.	 in every single Serbian place	 like in Croatia the Croatian names. I think thats fair. Dont forget the other countrys ect. Is this the solution Brian? Because of this NPOV Users there i  Vukovar who nobody charged? In Serbia not one day during the war and after the war and also now atack buildings with croatian or hungarian translation or names	 till today. To capitulate and to forget the croatian EU-law who gave the premission to use the latin and the serbian-cyrillic eaquel on administartiv niveau ect. where life a significant Serbian minority or majority? Me and you know thats can be the right way to capitulate and to forgat the law and the WP-Rules.

0	Your suggestion that the 'Literature' section should perhaps come first indeed sensible on reflection as your remark about a lead section and I will revise the article if it is restored. The list has to stay though. Really the whole reason I wrote the artcile was because I was so struck that every  emerging Western Buddhism group I offhand know of over the past fifty years has been tarnished	 not just peripherally but at its heart	 by this sort of sexual scandal and this is what makes it notable (I saw a remark that perhaps the page wasn't needed and but for this I would be inclined to agree - the trouble is if I make much of that then I fall into the 'original research' trap ). The first paper I reference essentially addresses the issue in an interesting	 and I think correct	 way. I did look at the FWBO article you mention and list it as an external source and I think one of the references (essentially favourable) I supplied came from there. It was also the basis of the remark I made that the community remained supportive of its founder. But I stress I'm not prepared to interest myself further in a page like this unless my original version is restored. Thank you for your remarks. Appreciated.

I do have to remind you	 though	 that if consensus is to create an article	 you should do so very cautiously without implying guilt of anything on the part of this woman if guilt has not been legally determined. Again	 we aren't here to take sides or have opinions. There are plenty of forums for that. We are here to create a scholarly reference work that neutrally represents previously published materials about subjects of enduring notability. (Wikilinks for added emphasis. I'm sure you've read these policies	 but as you are walking in a controversial area	 I really just wish to encourage extra caution.) No matter how hot fires are	 Wikipedia is meant to remain cool.

Newer tape media have very thin dense data tracks.  256	 384 and 768 data tracks on a half inch wide tape are now common.  While moving from one reel to another when loaded in the tape drive	 there may be some lateral tape movement that could cause the drive to 'lose track' of which data track it is reading.  By putting servo tracks on the back side of the media	 where it will not affect the actual data being stored	 the servo system of a tape drive can tell precisely which track is being accessed and allows the tape drive to accurately position the tape media.

1	hi. 
0	A tag has been placed on Benny Wa	 requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person	 group of people	 band	 club	 company	 or web content	 but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable	 that is	 why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion	 articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable	 and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable	 you may contest the tagging. To do this	 add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself	 but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.
0	Of course there is proof. You don't want it in the article	 so you and the Wikipedia administrators who are your friends have censored it out of the article. Wikipedia simply cannot be trusted to tell the truth about anything	 and you are part of the reason why it can't.

0	Why did you delete the bulk of the West St.Paul and East St.Paul articles for likely copywright violation? Are you able to prove that the articles were in violation of a copywright? I didn't write the article but the original articles were actually quite good	 and are now just a shell of their former selves. If you were certain the articles contained copywright vio why didn't you re-write them instead of just deleting everything?  Also	 much of what you have written on the Winnipeg articles is incorrect	 ie. Old Kildonan once being a part of East Kildonan (never was) and West Kildonan lying north of Inkster Blvd. (that was not the boundary)	 that Winnipeg's Mennonite population is 33	000 (not supported by statistics). Be sure that you are absolutely certain of the veracity of a fact and have done your research thoroughly before you write	 add to	 or edit an article. Otherwise readers will will receive misinformation and that is not what an encyclopaedia is intended for. The Winnipeg and city area articles are coming along quite nicely. Please don't delete any part of them for unsupportable reasons.

0	I'm certainly not meaning to own the article	 and I am sorry if it is coming across that way.  I have done a lot of research on this topic	 and unfortunately there aren't many other editors who watchlist the page.  The research does not support any allegation that romance novels are pornography	 although you are right that some people nonetheless use the term to describe the genre.  It is a controversial descriptor	 and as such I think it inappropriate to highlight it in the see also section.

But you are injecting into this forum your personal anti-American bias	 and I would like to know why you are watching this page so closely? Do you have something to hide and are you trying to promote your own version of history? The progressive movement became more popular after Wilson became a progressive it and everybody knows it. You are not the gatekeeper of history and you should not delete every change. I am an avid reader and I consider myself very knowledgable about history and important world events. You cannot study subjects in isolation from each other. Your comments are not very informative and serve to downplay the progressive movement. You should also provide suggestions as to where my input is supposed to be without deleting it arbitrarily. I am still going to put real information on this page and you will not be able to stop it. What is your native language? Perhaps you have a problem with English?

If he is speaking English and just happens to be on Twin Earth (ie. if he is Frederick's identical Earth twin and has been transported there unbeknown to him) then the context is not enough (or may not be enough - there is	 I believe	 some debate about this point) to change the meaning of his words and so his words may mean the same as Frederick's. That is why the point was made explicitly in my last version.

0	I do not believe that the claim that district	 city	 state is a standard naming convention is accurate.  At best	 I believe it is an undocumented and informal convention imposed on Wiki by a handful of contributors without any discussion.  If I'm wrong	 please correct me and point to the documentation of this convention (prior to the Hollywood rename) and discussion of convention prior to that.  Just because Hollywood is not a city does not mean it should not be listed as Hollywood (my preference) or Hollywood	 California.    The name of every Wiki article should reflect common usage as much as possible	 period.   Yes	 the convention for city names is city	 state	 but that's because that is common usage for cities!  But where does it say that place	 state necessarily implies that place is an incorporated city	 so that place	 state can only be used for actual cities?   What about all the unincorporated areas of every state?

0	I attempted to edit the promotion section of this article to explain that recorded music sales dropped 50% from the inception of Napster (and its progeny) in 1999 through 2009	 but it was reverted out by several Wikibullies	 who do not want that fact set forth. I also disputed the use of the term sharing	 which is a misnomer. Sharing is a computer concept whereby a network of computers share access so that computer A can access a file on computer B	 but the file remains resident on computer B. Copying is a simple concept whereby the file on computer B is copied to computer B. Napster was designed to facilitate copying	 but the proponents of Napster called it sharing for propaganda purposes	 since the unauthorized copying of a copyrighted work is a civil and criminal offense and morally wrong. Sharing sounds like something your elementary school teacher wanted you to do. If you share a sandwich	 the other person eats half of your sandwich. If you log onto a so-called file-sharing system	 the other person copies your song	 but you keep your copy	 too. The Courts held that Napster was a giant copyright infringement. However	 it was very popular and still has many proponents on Widipedia	 who still insist on calling it sharing and don't want the fact that their sharing wiped out the music industry (and a lot of recording arists with it)	 because that makes them immoral people. Now they add CENSORSHIP to their bad acts.

1	You reported me to AIV? Hilarious. That's one of the dick moves Werieth pulled too. Although he only did it as he knew reporting me to SPI would have probably brought him to much attention - at that stage he was still trying to keep the whole thing quiet	 as it obviously benefited him. Not that he need have worried - every admin that ever responded to him	 either at SPI or AIV	 took the exact same view of my socking as as you espouse here (although obviously some were motivated by more than just incompetence). As such	 it's likely your report to AIV is only going to ensure their names don't get picked up and the systems/attitudes/culture that cause this obviously counter-productive reaction don't get fixed - meaning that Werieth might as well try his arm at another return later. It speaks volumes that you'd think reverting me was remotely a good thing	 even though in that very same ANI there's an arb explaining how he could have probably picked up on this whole thing much earlier if it wasn't for just that sort of mindless cycle of reversion and blocking of obvious socks	 on the basis all socking is ebil. It's beyond idiotic.

1	I'm giving up on this one. Wikipedia not only censors its articles	 but it removes comments. Happy truthiness	 Wikipedia. What a joke you are.
0	No	 the text that I entered is not an opinion but a reasoned statement. It is not an interpretation but a reasoned statement. It may be that you are right that there should not be a separate criticism section	 but	 given the first part of the article	 this reasoned statement can be put here. My suggestion is that more people think through what the article would look like but including the reasoned statement in the main body of the article. It is useful to have the text available in the article before the whole is re-editted	 to prevent innocent readers to get a wrong impression.

His sales with albums and singles followed the trends exactly for the 80`s and 90`s. Infact he was at the hight of these trends with HIstory. He stuck at the top of the market until 1997.

Like a math book - who wrote it or why is irrelevant ( except for motivation... ) if the ideas in it portray reality ( real events and history ) accurately then it has soome value. If the book ( math ... ) gets it all wrong then you revise/dump it. Is the article ever going to get down to discussing where the Protocols are incorrect? Whining about what bad guys wrote it just prolongs the agony - who ever wrote it and/or even why they did may be interesting but off the point.159.105.80.141
0	I am amazed that there could have been such a major exercise over this extremely modest article which conained nothing contentious or manufatured. There was a good set of source material given for such a minor article	 in fact more than I have seen on countless other articles where often there are none at all. Looking back to when I created the article observers will see that I only attributed actual quotes to two writers. I cited Anderson as my source for much of the article but I did not actually quote him (although I lifted much from him). My edition is the revised 1867 (9 volume) set. But there are many editions of this work. I have seen editions as late as the 1890s and condensed into two big volumes. A glance at ABE Books will give some idea of the number of editions available.

0	Keep in mind that WP:3RR limits distruptive editing	 whether or not 3 reverts have been reached.

Even what Kesey himself said later about the book should be clearly differentiated from what the book itself actually says.

0	I disagree with your general thesis. The article on a certain person should not necessarily focus on his or her perspective and should definitely try to be neutral. The article on Gengis Khan is not mostly written from Gengis Khan's perspective. Even if I did agree with your thesis	 you would still be wrong since criticism of Freeman's critique does not constitute Mead's point of view. She was dead by the time. Criticism of Freeman's critique can at most be considered the perspective of her followers. It is violates neutrality to blatantly overrepresent her followers perspective. -Sensemaker.

0	Ed	 I am tired!  Anyway	 I certainly did not mean to trivialize the suffering of vicitms of racism	 only to say that most scientists  racist and anti-racist  have not been persecuted the way Galileo was.  Perhaps racist scientists should be.  But even here I would qualify it  not only do I not want to put some racist scientists in the US or Canada in the same category of Joseph Mengele	 I think the crucial difference is precisely the social context  we live in a society based on free debate where a few scientists can be racist and they will be challenged publically and a well-informed public can make up its mind.  In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies	 both here and in Germany	 and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things.  But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part	 thanks in part to open scientific debate	 and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures	 their work has not had the same awful effect.

It is difficult to understand why someone interested in Jeremy Sinden should instead rush across to his far less well-known brother's article and immediately feel the need to remove tags? The tags remain because the article is in severe need of a rewrite	 not least because one of the main contributors has claimed to be a 'good friend' and a 'fan' of Marc Sinden from the age of 12(!)	 when they met on the set of the 'Hey Jude' video recording(!). Unfortunately this is the very same editor that was caught dragging along a bucket-load of socks to try and support various POV positions and outright puffery of Marc Sinden and Sinden-related articles. Amazingly enough	 this editor and their socks have added Marc Sinden's name to around 130 articles on Wikipedia. 130! For someone who's less notable than my goldfish!

I've spent over eight hours trying to be comprehensive and juggling and such so would really not want to have to redo that or spurn your work tr. I think there's still a long way to go but I need another pair of eyes. The Rough Boundaries of the District Run from B street at the Union Depot and runs to 1st street. The union distric6t is described as a economic center for Pueblo. The reason the Obama visit is included because not only does it and other visits to that paticular area help denote it's notability but it is a major political area too. In 1995 we approved a bond of some million dollars to recover from a recession. I need to be descriptive but I don't want it to be a Circle jerk either	 basically a counter-wait to my own small Conflict of Interest since I live here. Maybe not a major reformat since I can easily afdd a lot of more sources	 Just a few pointers to look at. I hope the lack of sleep made this understandable and if not I hope you get my drift. I'm going to bed I'll have to continue tomorrow.

0	Amen to that.  The name of article implies a connection with the banking crisis.  That link is spurious.  American car manufacturers make an inferior product and are massively burdened with huge retired-worker costs and strong unions.  As a result	 they have not been profitable and the recent petrol prices and now the funding crisis (due to the banking crisis) have brought them to the edge - sooner than they would otherwise have got there.  Foreign car manufacturers are not in this position and do not have the same history and it is absolutely *wrong* to lump them into this article.

I tagged the KVMX redirect page for speedy delete in order to move the page and she took care of the move for me (sometimes the admins just delete the page and I have to move it myself). I really think the KBKO page should remain a disambiguate page with a listing for KVMX stating it was formerly KBKO-FM	 that way they can still get to the new station if they happen to type KBKO. That's generally how we handle this kind of change.

It is a longstanding problem that he makes these kinds of moves in bulk without trying to gauge consensus first.

There is a recent study of Roth stuff too by Iain Davidson. My papers etc come from Indigneous studies units from several different unis so not sure they would be in published journals as such though some would be though I have numerous (maybe 300 arch papers on Indigenosu Oz).  Approach the Humanities faculty at MU maybe or the head Prof at any uni that offers Indigneous Studies quals and ask can wik have some content so that what goes up isnt total nonsense.  Not all goes on the databases but gets included in different 'Indigenous Studies readings' that are course materials.

He then provided a specific example (her making the economic argument for collectivizing Amazon) that falls in line with the positions she taken on the record	 criticizing the private investor ownership of corporations. I'm unsure a more logical way to read the passage. The passage in the article is a verbatim reflection of that portion of the article.

0	My complaint is that a change that you correctly identify as obvious is still not made because of the bias and special relationship which you and slrubenstein appear to have. If you make it this difficult to change something so obviously biased	 I dread to think what it would be like to bring this article to neutrality. My complaint is therefore that in my opinion you are biased and using your administrative tools to promote that bias	 a neutral party would have made the change instead of wasting my time here. It is unacceptable that a partisan vets every edit.

He thinks that he can communicate with people outside of his underworld	 but he really can't without pointing fingers	 screaming and shouting etc. Typical Balkan syndrome. I actually find it funny that he even tries to engage in various arguments with me -whether that sounds arrogant to you or not - simply because there is no way of him knowing what I know if you live in present day Croatia.

0	A combined work can only be seen as a mixture of derivative works and collective works and this is not helpful in an article. Please note that if you discuss things with me and then add text that was not agreed	 it seems that you are mainly interested to steal my time. Moglen is not a trustworthy source as he is well known for publishing intentionally false claims with the intention to use this to get political results. Given that I just forward statements from Rosen and Determan who are trustworthy sources	 it should be easy to write a correct article with citations from trustworthy sources.
0	I noticed that someone changed the redirect to another sister article of DMK. If clearly different opinions exist on the best redirect	 a DAB page might be a good compromise to avoid an edit war. Before creating the DAB	 I also tested a small sample of airport codes	 like HKG	 SGP	 AMS	 CDG. A good proportion of them are DAB pages. So the DAB page seemed like a good solution here. DMK is still very new	 so the number of references is probably still small. That makes it only more important that it can be found easily in WP. −

Unfortunately	 one or more of your edits  have not conformed to Wikipedia's verifiability policy	 and have been reverted.  Wikipedia articles should refer only to facts and interpretations that have been stated in print or on reputable websites or other forms of media.  Always remember to provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is likely to be challenged	 or it may be removed.  Wikipedia also has a related policy against including original research in articles.

So... these are not personal opinions of other translations this is an outcry against discrimination.  And it wasn't just the Hogganvik you deleted my changes from; there were seven others.

0	There are a couple variants of this layout-style	 which I guess can be called option#G_double_barrel	 and my original idea which is option#G_all_on_the_right.  The main advantage of option#G	 either flavor	 is compactness.  You don't need captions on the photos	 although hover-click would be a nice bonus; I didn't try to implement that though.  You also don't need a separate gallery	 which saves space.  And	 although the textual-info is relatively compact	 and the pics are lined up with the textual-info	 you don't need to have vertical column orientation (like option#C) and you don't need to have excess whitespace (like option#D and like the dem-list or the potus-list).  I'm not sure I actually *like* option#G	 either variant	 but it is a viable option methinks	 and may satisfy some folks who desire easy-to-correlate pics but are against excess whitespace.  75.108.94.227

0	Yes	 there was criticism in the article	 suggesting evaporation as the source of the thurst. However	 it was (together with all criticisms) removed/censored by POV pushing editors. No control for mass was done in either experiment	 and evaporation of order of less than microgram per second could easily explain the effect (especially in the NASA case); even more so	 if there is some moisture. What you are essentially doing	 is microwaving the interior of a cone	 and - surprise surprise - there is a small force in the opposite direction. Then you turn off the heating	 but your interior is still at higher temperature	 measure it again	 and there is still a force - yet smaller. Nothing to do with exotic physics	 everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation	 i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect	 especially if there are parts other than metal; this is	 in my opinion	 the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article	 though all was sourced). So	 if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects	 virtual plasma included	 boil down to EM radiation reaction	 there is no violation of impulse conservation there	 so that is excluded too)	 it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However	 they did not check for that. Also	 some of experiments were done in atmosphere (at atmospheric pressure	 even in chamber?! according to brief paper)	 so other possibility is interaction with heated air. However	 in vacuum	 ablation seems to be most likely explanation. Why all this sourced material and all criticism was removed	 beats me. 213.198.221.171

0	The law concerning the papal elections has been changed in the meantime. When Stephen was elected it was neccessary to receive episcopal consecration to assume the papal office. After the Decree In Nomine Domini of Pope Nicholas II (1059) the elect could have exercised papal office immadiately after his election	 no matter whether already bishop or not. Besides	 it is neccessary to distinguish the rites of episcopal consecration and of coronation. Celestine IV received episcopal consecration in 1238	 three years before his election to the papacy	 because in this year he became bishop of Sabina. He died before coronation	 but not before episcopal consecration. Stephen was not a bishop when elected pope.

The Nasty Boys are also a recent addition to this practice. TNA is kind enough to let these old wrestlers put together matches on TV every so often.
0	I have no idea which version is correct but we should not be edit warring over the issue. I suggest that everyone takes a step back	 reads WP:NPOV and notes that we should reflect all valid opinions. If there is an inability to gain consensus regarding the reliability of source(s) then the correct course to take is to refer the specific source(s) and the specific statements to the Reliable Sources Noticeboard. This thing is a Featured Article and any resolution really does have to be done carefully	 not disruptively. -

0	Actually	 fibromyalgia is not a syndrome per se.  Fibromyalgia Syndrome is a syndrome.  The primary document for the classification of fibromyalgia upon wch the de facto diagnostic criteria are derived states there are two defining criteria	 i.e. chronic widespread pain and pain on palpation.  The comorbid symptoms that characterize the syndrome are not part of the classification of FM per se.  Perhaps you should consider starting a new WP article on FM syndrome where you would be able to input all your pseudo-editorial dross and take all your asinine MUPS/MUS crusading with you.  71.212.10.108

0	Labeling Turkey as a Middle Eastern regional power is nothing but Euro-centrism. France and Germany are considered regional powers but no one refers to them as European regional powers. Russia is a regional power	 mainly in Central Asia with the only influence in Europe being Belarus and no one refers to Russia as a Central Asian regional power. Giving Turkey's regional power another title is nothing but forcing an identity that other countries are not forced to accept. This is open racism and I would expect better from the editors of Wikipedia.  12:28	 11 August 2012 (EST)

You cant have a charge in a vaccum there is no vaccum. there is mass  around the vaccum where the charge coming from. Maybe the three current thing is bullshit. but it makes sense to me	 to explain how electrical power generation works	 becuase there are three entities	 of radiation pressure	 which is what electricity really is. Talking about it as if there are two things	 only current and voltage	 leaves out something big. the trouble is everyone is brainwashed	 and you cant explain the difference	 between the current is generation and the current in usage. These are separate entities. This termonology is a dogmatic religeon. There is no energy coming from the atom. It is radiating from it	 just like a piece of uranium radiates into you and gives you cancer. There is no difference	 is terms of what is atomicly happening	 when you have electricity	 then when you have nuclear decay. Its all radioation	 just electricty	 happens to be prodcuing less of it.

0	I always thought that the shunt diodes were needed. The conceptual model that one diode is on during each half cycle	 shorting out the corresponding cap isn't quite right.  What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down	 depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged	 so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes	 because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode	 but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.

0	OK	 probably this isn't going to go anywhereyou see no value here and I see value and I don't see that changing. I also think we should cover things that meet WP:N unless there is a good reason not to.  I suspect if you hit random 10 times	 some 3+ articles would be below the bar you've set.  But ignoring all that	 why does deletion help here? I just don't see the case.
0	Exactly	 I have done a google search for ANYTHING relating to Carrie Underwood and Chad Eagleton	 as well as search of the Oklahoma Today website and found no verifying information.  I think we should face the facts that Mia2007	 NSUBOY	 TXmaster and the non-registered IP user who adds the information is himself Chad Eagleton	 who was fortunate enough to snap a picture with Carrie Underwood	 and claims to be her boyfriend.

0	Well	 as for reliable sources	 it's basicly the word of the government of Iran and all professional media in the country V the word of some rioters. The reliability of both could be disputed	 what's clear is that as they are the conflicting sides here	 both should be represented	 which isn't happening. As for the fact government employees were given the day off	 it should be included	 but the way in which it was included was not neutrally phrased. As for source 17	 according to WP policies blogs belonging to major newspapers can be used as source	 however since the writer of this blog is clearly extremely biased	 his biased views should not be put in that way	 into the article. Now my problem is nto with the reliability of the LA-Times	 but with the fact that this man was completely baselessly labelled as a plainclothed policeman	 while there is no proof of that at all. The blogger claims this because of seeing an amateur video	 but how do any of us know he is an undercover policeman? He could be an angry government supporter	 he could be a terrorist	 he could be a random gunman	 he could be an agent of the CIA or even the Iranain Green Movement itself	 sent to open fire for propaganda reasons. Who knows? It should just not be reported like that	 especially since the government has denied opening fire on protestors and this video is being used in this article to prove them wrong.

0	Thanks	 see I knew there was a good reason I asked.  Know that you mention it I think your right regarding the shape and number of the articles that could be featured. Maybe once I get a few more cleaned up I will revisit the idea.  I have only recently started dabbling in GA's and Featured pictures and I have yet to have much success with DYK's or topics but I am planning to look into those again as well to build up the MOH content. Right now there are several Featured lists	 no featured articles (but a couple that I think have the potential (Charles Lindbergh	 Eddie Rickenbacher	 Teddy Roosevelt and a few others) but still need some work. I have 2 MOH recipients in GA review now but it takes at least a month typically before anyone looks at them	 Charles Lindbergh just got out of Peer review and I am going to submit that up for the next level review	 a couple more (Eddie Rickenbacher and Teddy) for peer review	 etc	 etc. My goal is to have at least a dozen articles to GA or better by the end of the year and all the lists (except maybe the ACW)	 still got a lot of work to do so we'll see.

0	Let me spell it out for you. The content of the page you are using as an excuse to put up the speedy deletion tag is a quote from a blog that belongs to me. I am the owner of the blog. What evidence do you need exactly? You have also accused me of originating the article here when the author is someone else and two other people have been accused of sock-puppetry on no evidence. The instructions for the tag say that someone who has originated the article may remove it. That is what I did because I am not the article's originator

I did a quick check at their talk pages -> [] and the first thing we see are buddy chats that indicate they certainly help each other achieve their editing/delete objectives	 ie sonia	Ktr101	Off2riorob. Its unfortunate that sg editors are getting fewer and less active than previous years. Hopefully sg articles in wiki will not get dominated by foreigners.
0	Lega Trentino is gathering a regionalist coalition	 but it needs to join forces with FI and AN (allies of Lega Nord both in Rome and in Trento) if they want to win the election. FI leadership is anyway divided on Divina as candidate: some of them support him	 others consider him a bad choice. What is sure is that Lega Trentino jumped to 16.5% in the last general election in Trentino and that Divina is supported by other regionalists	 notably Bezzi	 former leader and MP of PATT	 and possibly also by the rest of PATT. Is it clear	 now?

Eventually	 I will have to ask other admins to oversee this	 and they will probably look into your insistence on removing sourced mentions of criticism	 your dubious rewording and the fact that this article is an established target of a marketing firm	 which Berri has paid substantial money to in order to whitewash his image.

0	I strongly disagree whith your opinion	 but since I'm clearly outnumbered I'll accept your decision; in my opinion	 the most information it's removed	 the least useful this article becomes: the only “opening year” isn't really relevant	 if it's taken individually - and despite being stable data	 they're alike questionable (at least for early systems) - and this way even the sortability of the table   becomes pointless: it'll be more rational to revert the article to a mere	 simple list as it was before March 2013 (if I correctly saw in the “history”). Conversely	 the reader's usefulness of collecting statistic data in such a global list is far bigger than adding that to a nationwide/continental list: if you're interested in some specific system you can go directly to their individial Wiki pages	 while if you aim to a world overview	 it's somewhat tiring to “search	 open & match” a handful of different article. Don't take it to heart	 but I don't intend to further contribute to this list: good luck with your project	 but from my personal point of view as reader/user it doesn't worth the needed time and effort.

0	This is a distortion. I agree that a separate article on Mr. Chase was not justified; I said so in the press last December. But while I played a role in identifying Mr. Chase	 it was the New York Times and John Seigenthaler	 Sr. who had more influence than I when it came to getting his name into print. And as I recall	 Mr. Seigenthaler had a private word with you about how he might identify the vandal	 and you gave him a song and dance about how Wikipedia is helpless (and by implication	 blameless) in these matters. You didn't try very hard to help Mr. Seigenthaler. I tried a little bit harder than you. And now you slam me for violating this poor fellow's privacy. Mr. Wales	 you owe me an apology.

0	This article	 which originally appeared in the London Independent on August 13	 2002	 is	 I think	 excellent in both sensitively disputing the official account of Flight 93 and highlighting the US media's reluctance to do so.

Otherwise	 I maintain that parts of this wikipedia article is based on American public opinion rather than fact.
0	Yes we can delete them but through speedy tags and AFD discussions. It appears that it has been renominated for deletion	 dated Jan 13. IMO	 the page is doomed for deletion.

0	I agree this article is not based on Sarah Palin. That is why I want the revert. Since those comments many edits have been made to the article	 and it would be foolish to assume those edits were made solely with intent to improve the article. I think this talk page alone is enough evidence of that. Prior to comments made	 the article hadn't been edited in weeks and most of the edits prior to that were minor edits	 mostly a bunch of grammar and some reworking of sentences and sentence structure. I think the lack of editing of the article and the nature of previous edits shows that for such a longstanding article	 there was a silent consensus that the article was good and needing very little.

0	This assumption that German is the largest ancestry in the U.S. shows how the ancestry chart in the article is a little misleading	 because most of the 20.2 million people who claim an undifferentiated ‘American’ ancestry are thought to be of English ancestry	 in addition to the 24.5 million who actually specify English ancestry. Even if we decide to exclude all the Catholic Irish	 most of whom were English-speaking British subjects when they migrated	 roughly half of Irish Americans	 or about 15 million	 are thought to be Protestants	 mostly from Ulster	 and therefore mostly of mainland British ancestry too. So in fact there are many more Americans of British descent than of German descent	 and they still use their language. In addition	 German Americans assimilated and only a small proportion of them speak German. Almost all of them speak English instead. This lack of cultural affinity in descendants has had important historical consequences. It helps to explain why German-American relations have been more distant than the ethnic chart would otherwise suggest	 and why German ancestry hasn't always been a big enough factor to overcome diplomatic differences.

If demand is high and supply is low	 price is high... etc.  Petroleum can be stored in many places	 such as in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (727 million barrels).  Global strategic petroleum reserves hold over 4 billion barrels.  Supply	 which is the refined petroleum (and other liquids) available in the open market	 is affected by releases of strategic reserves (note that production is not the same as supply).  Depending on the source you read demand and usage might not even be the same thing	 as demand might include buyers for strategic reserves.

We already know media uses both	 in ratios that are possibly varying by context	 sometimes geographically	 and at least occasionally out of politics; and that it's possible to cherry pick sets that show almost exclusive use of one or the other.  Picking one for the article name needs to be done as neutrally as possible (given that there are POV overloads on both version); and defaulting to what the country's official name is – and the name official bodies call it &nash; is the most rational action.

You can't put that information as back than the professional players were in the war	 and sometimes games played day after day and even in some cases two games of United were played at the same day with 11 diffrent players in each stadium. I will give you an example to today	 same as back than when during games players from diffrent teams could play at any team they wished for (wartime guest players and few more names). see the game last season against Juve which United lost 1-2 to Juve	 but the game involved 6 of United former players	 which played that game as a testimonial match for Gary Neville	 Yes it was United game	 But as it wasn't competetive it shouldn't be added to the team record books (no matter the score line	 even if they would ended up winning 20-0 or lost at that score).   –

0	You're talking about the quote at the end of the Personal relationships section. I would guess that it means he's saying he's open to sexual relationships with men. A reference to bisexuality. But no one knows for certain what his sexual orientation was (except those who claim they know)	 which is why we have a section on speculation about it.
0	Now you are not making any sense. My previous warnings have nothing to do with this (and are really result of rules changing since when I stated sontributing.

0	Regarding your edits to Airport 
0	I gave some firm evidence. The observation is my own and I have made all but one observation public. I have given my reason for making it clear that I have the suspicion of connectivity which may be collusion. I have said that the evidence is prima facie and not based on anything more than the evidence I have presented plus the information I am keeping back. If necessary I will inform an Administrator of the other evidence that I have	 but I do not think that would be helpful for the editor concerned for this to get that far.  I have nothing to apologise for given that I have been prepared to put the evidence (most of it at least) on the table. You should not be offended really IMHO because the point of coming to a noticeboard is to get opinions from independent editors. As on the face of it you all have something very much in common you should be happy to drop out of the argument and let other editors who do not have a proclivity to editing articles on extremist politics to make their comments known. That's all that we expect from any noticeboard. Comments from the interested parties plus assistance from disconnected ones. You do not appear to be disconnected from this subject or some of the other editors who have commented.

Apart	 of course	 from Lawrence of Arabia	 there's the bizarre Doughty (who believed that all English literature after Chaucer was basically worthless - I read Arabia Deserta (in a good edited version by Penguin) about 20 years ago) and also Richard Burton (who first translated and published the Thousand and One Nights in an almost unreadably bad translation that (apparently!) is only notable for his deliberate exaggeration of the pornographic sections of the Tales).

0	Thanks for your message. I have already spent far too much time on the issue	 so that I shall not take any further action. J Milburn's argument is faulty: one cannot remove an image on the possibility of the events that may or may not take place in the future; the relevant question is whether my copyright statement is incorrect at the time being	 and the answer to this is clearly in the negative (at least Milburn has not come up with a free image of Michael Foot	 thereby showing that my copyright statement were invalid) so that the image must stay. I have argued	 but to no avail	 that when a free image turns up (there is no a priori reason why a free image should at all become available at any foreseeable time from now)	 that event renders my present copyright statement invalid	 at which instance the present image must be replaced by the available free image. At present no law is violated	 so that there is no reason why the image should be removed. But I have said this many times	 and unless .

Russification in the 20th century is of historic interest and the ANC	 among other buildings	 is relevant to this. It's also visually interesting. Of course	 then we should note its significance and the divided views. A personal view: some of the photos add little. There are two virtually identical rooftop views (pretty	 but one's enough!) and an indistinct harbour view. We need some shots of	 for example	 city transport and suburban buildings	 old and new. Tallinn is not all old town and Hansa heritage; shots of Toompea	 Kadriorg and some of the Soviet era buildings would also be informative. Come on	 you Tallinners!!

You may say that	 occasionally	 my tone has been less than wholly level and that this constitutes a form of mild rudeness. However	 my point in this thread that there is also a different kind of rudeness  utterly ignoring those who question your actions and attempt to have a reasonable discussion with you. I have legitimate concerns	 which I have set out at length in a responsible fashion. Those concerns have been utterly ignored. No attempt has been made to respond to them. If I was wrong	 it should be a simple matter to demonstrate it. The person about whom I have those concerns has simply deleted any attempt at discussion from her Talk page. This is	 in my view	 improper behaviour not to mentio rude in itself. Other than that	 I see reflexively defensive behaviour from what appears to be a self-supporting clique of administrators. 90.213.182.228

Roux has insulted	 blittled	 slandered and dogged me for months now; knowing that because we edit the same pages because we have the same interests (with me being around long before him) we could not avoid each other indefinitely	 I have done my utmost to resolve the matter in the most professional manner I could muster. But that process could not take place with Roux immune to any criticism; if you can find any evidence of anything beyond critique of his edits and editing habits - that is	 actual attack	 name calling	 insulting - and one shred of proof that I ever stalked him	 I urge that it be presented. To do otherwise is a incomprehensible abuse of position.

0	Thank you for proving to me so effectively that nobody here reads anything anyone says	 except the bits they're interested in (this is exactly the same thing Dave and Charles and everyone else does here). As anyone can see	 I didn't make any insulting comments about Dave	 I explained to you why people like Dave will always feel insulted when the truth is pointed out to them. Or are you seriously suggesting that by highlighting the fact that Dave said something that was provably false about me (and articles and Wikipedia rules)	 is in your book	 an insult? To him? If anything	 that's an insult to me (and Wikipedia). But yes	 I'm well aware now that this isn't something that remotely concerns you. Or is that insulting to you now? Who knows. Wikipedia seems to have a moral compass all of its own. I will admit to calling Charles a troll	 because he is one. It seems a shame to me that you're not willing to even investigate whether he is one before you will block me though. Apparently my only crime here is to not say it on a noticeboard. There's not much that can be said about that sort of outlook	 but it's pretty obvious what effect it's going to have on people who are the victims of such trolling.

0	It isn't about dumbing down	 it's about the use of unambiguous language. The articles linked to by phenomena and artefact still leave the meanings of those words ambiguous. We don't have to stick religiously to the words used in the literature	 particularly if	 like with these	 they are ambiguous in English. We should paraphrase if we need to	 especially if it is a literal	 rather than a meaning	 translation from French as much of this appears to be. I think we need to forge a compromise between what is there now	 and something  easier to grasp the true meaning of. I'll offer the following as a starter in this spirit:

They would be launched by a special catapult and would land on a flexible rubber deck. Trials were even carried out with a mock deck at Farnborough	 using Sea Vampire aircraft. After initial setbacks the concept proved practical	 but even so	 the Admiralty abandoned the idea.

On the other hand	 if they are supporting the relevant point that academic publication in the modern field of OHP occurred before some start date	 they should probably stay.

1	You idiot	 ever since I first heard of Santa when I was 4 years old I NEVER believed he was real. Any kid who is SMART AND LOGICAL would never believe it either. My parents never gave me stupid delusions of it either. I used to go around my 2nd-grade class and say Santa wasn't real and the teacher told me to stop but I didn't. You are preventing children from developing their logical thinking skills if you tell them it's possible to travel to every household in Christendom in a single night. Considering in TV and movies Santa spends at least a few minutes inside a house delivering presents and eating cookies. The time doesn't add up. Those were my exact thoughts at 4 years old and that's how I deduced he couldn't be real. If your kid doesn't think like that he's retarded and you're not helping him by saying that's possible.

His assertions are laughably absurd and he has been reported for his violation of 3RR and appears to be using sockpuppets to wage an edit war in an article that has already seen too many. Please don't indulge this kind of disruptive user.

0	No trey YOU try to own it	 with comments like Comments (other than those from HeadMouse) would be helpful I did not remove your references	 if you go back in the history you will see the refs I removed went no where. and there were only 2 of them there. I try to keep this article clean and Presentable. FUNNY HOW THIS ARTICLE WAS JUST FINE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG ANS MESSED IT UP!!!
0	Having reviewed that statement	 I see it contained yet another legal threat.  You are blocked indefinitely. 96
0	I have not engaged in any disruptive edits in the Wite American article. I really do not know what you're talking about. I have provided very reliable sources of references. It is the author who is disagreement with the truth behind the references. He is the one who makes disruptive edits and it is considered vandalism on his part.I do not know what his true motives are behind his denial of my sources	 other than the fact that he is one-sided and does not understand and accept European history	 since he is not European. Caution him to refrain from disrputive editing as such actions violate wiki policy. Have him read the following link to warn him of being blocked from editing on wiki articles: blocked from editing.
0	While I personally feel that reliance on long quotes show a lack of sources on a topic	 and typically smell of a POV pushing	 in this article they are fine	 as long as they don't say the same thing an earlier section has. There is too much reduncancy in this aritcle as it is	 and the long quotes are used to push ones personal view	 rather than a balanced	 multiple sourced statement. -
0	By the way. Saedon's recent participation in this article is most likely due to the fact that I made edits on an article that he also so happens to be working on. If not some strange coincidence	 it is very likely that it was a result of going through my user contributions page. I could say similar things about one other editor. So I thought maybe that is the reason why these edit wars are getting so big. Just a hypothesis for now. If you agree	 back me up on it. Thanks.''''—Expert Sectioneer'' of Wikipedia86 = 19+9+14 + karma = 19+9+14 + talk 
0	No it isn't.  Apart from being self-serving because you uploaded the image in the first place	 you can't source an image off EBay	 because it is a commercial reproduction of an image	 not the original.

0	This matter is so old that it has dropped off WP:AE; if you want to know the history	 or some of it	 you will have to go to [[WP:Arbitration/Requests/Clarification	 or to the history of AE.
0	I didn't want to bring it into the debate as really it's irrelevant but equally I don't want to drag everyone to arbitration on an article we've all spent time trying to perfect simply because a single editor seems to have agendas beyond the quality of the encyclopaedia. Some of the unbalanced	 illogical and contrary positions being taken were simply getting too unbelievable!

0	I have given plenty of reason to remove the spoiler - it is unenyclopedic	 it serves no purpose to the article	 it reduces article quality by improperly placing story details out of context without explaining their sigificance. You are abusing a rule; you are ignoring the details of that rule	 which state that spoilers must serve an encyclopedic purpose which is not the case here. You are despicable.
0	do not removing me again
0	Ratnakar	 you just dont get what POV is. POV is a kind of content dispute	 in which someone sees content as being biased. And the tag works so that when an editor places it it stays in place untill there is a consensus that it is not necessary. Revert yourself	 or I will report you for edit warring. ·snunɐw·

Please be respectful of this and quit arguing the silly point of what FIFA thinks he is. They are not Uebergods on Nationality.

I think it is to do with one's nation's guilt; to render Japan culpable for Iraq will render for instance the United States or Australia to which those users belong in the same conspirators. You will win I guess	 I doubt those users have any extensive knowledge of international law on the tests of sovereingty and Nuremburg precedents. To them	 their concept of war crimes in a very lay and faux popular fasion is narrowly limited to as you said: death	 physicial injury and physically induced mental injury. It extends greater than that to the realms of conspiracy of primary and secondary participants in the creation and exectution of aggressive policies	 and suggested in obiter dictum	 inchoate actions for the purpose of aggression.

I think most German to English machine translations are ok	 but one of the passages confused the machine translations because of an idiomatic phrase	 and the other one was a problem because of complex sentence structure interacting with sarcasm.

0	A true atheist doesn't have moral fiber as atheism doesn't provide any sort of moral guidelines to adhere to. A true atheist will never do anything unless it benefits them somehow or it feels good. The technical term for that is hedonism. Try and deny it all you want	 Brian was praying and the context of the situation makes that so clear that anyone who actually watched the episode would have to be either blind and deaf or just plain dense to not understand what happened. If doing the right thing involves sacrifice that has no personal benefit	 an atheist will take the easy way out every single time but this time Brian didn't. There is no way around this except to correct the gross inaccuracy of this article concerning Brian's religious beliefs or at least acknowledge that there is evidence to suggest otherwise which there clearly is.
0	I have made myself perfectly clear.  & if your intention is to treat a 21st century encyclopedia as one that does make readily available the actual text of a discussed bill	 then I fret to think of the world you might have us live in.

The NDAA page is designed to discuss the bill's relavancy to the government and its people	 both in a past and present context.

0	In all honesty	 this article is probably a marginal nomination for deletion on the basis of Junie Browning lacking notability. A number of TUF cast members got articles	 then those articles got deleted when they never really went on to do anything in MMA. That being said	 even if we're to leave it up	 your suggestion has two problems. One is that Junie Browning is a living person and Wikipedia has certain policies about biographies of living people	 secondly	 a lot of the stuff you mention is either not externally citable from a credible source or not citable at all. A 'criticisms' section of that nature would be seriously undue weight	 the whole concept is just kinda silly. Whatever your personal butthurt is over Junie Browning aside	 the article should probably be deleted. Not expanded.

I've consistently indicated my desire to discuss the content and have somebody else edit the page	 but nobody wants to edit the page anymore because every single minor edit gets stomped without discussion	 and then we have to endure your complaints and we can't fail to notice your complete lack of content discussion.

Today	 our family finally received a small settlement from Babcox-Wilcox -  TWENTY FOUR years after my dad died from mesothelioma and two years after my mother died.  Frankly	 I had forgotten about it.   I'm sure my mother would have wished her last 20 years to have been with her husband.  I know I missed having a dad.   Was that worth $50	000?  Not on your life.  All that did for me is bring back memories	 and the kind of grief that has never gone away.  Not even after 24 years.

0	Sorry for horning into your talk page	 but I'm still drafting the remount service article and hope to do one on the remount concept as well. Early on the Army decided that it was cost-prohibitive to maintain whole herds	 so they used the remount stations to house selected stallions and then contracted out with local horse breeders to provide mares. Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized (after World War I)	 but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West. One thing the remount service is credited with (as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 20-25 years) was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service. This was because the Army didn't (and couldn't) buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didn't meet standards or were otherwise unneeded.

0	Well I think once someone can find a proper source then why not. But it needs to be made sure that it isn't coated with a hidden agenda	 which unfortunately seems to persist in these kinds of articles. Let's not forget mainstream academics studying Hunnic history know of only 3 Hunnic words and a few names here and there. The obscurity of Hunnic history makes it hard to come to a conclusion on its ethnic and linguistic origins. Some say they were primarily Turkic	 others say Iranian	 others Slavic	 some even say Uralic	 etc. Then to suddenly have an unknown source with a very suspicious title and background making claims about the Turkic form of Hunnic names is rather suspicious. If there can be a proper way to find this gentleman's book without having to go through nationalistic websites	 it would perhaps give us a better indication of the man's original message. Sadly these nationalistic websites aren't to be trusted. Some even have a habit of trying to push something that the author in question may not have intended. I've already come across 3 dubious references in wiki articles today	 unfortunately all of which are related in some form or another to the mythical Turanian pseudoscience.

0	The current infobox of this section	 wich represents the largest cities of the country	 can be quite misleading for those not used to the subdivion system of the country	 since the information contained in this box refers to the population of the main municipality only	 not to the whole of the urban area wich contains it. The figures for the urban area of São Paulo	 for instance	 are twofold that of the municipality of São Paulo	 displayed here. I don't think there is any other country page in this encyclopedia wich works this way and I advise you to look around for any precedent. I strongly suggest this infobox to be replaced by another one	 wich shows the actual figure for what really matters	 i.e.	 the population of the urban sprawl itself	 not only the jurisdiction of the main city.

0	If the KLA had a Tactical Victory	 they would've completed their strategic goal	 if they had a Decisive Victory	 they would've killed almost all the Yugoslav Army troops	 but the truth is	 they have killed around 50 or 30 or 45 Yugoslav Troops. Just like the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia	 the NATO said they destroyed about 400 or 200 Armored Assault vehicles. But the truth is	 that they destroyed only 22 or less vehicles. The Yugoslav had Volunteers from Russia	 Greece	 and I believe Yugoslav volunteers. NATO was involved	 but had about six Aircraft (B-2 1	 F-16 2	 and AC-130 2)	 I believe the aircraft in the parenthesis are the ones that were used	 but didn't inflict casualties	 but for the F-16	 I believe inflicted casualties 8. So Yugoslavia had less casualties than the KLA because regular troops are stronger than Militias or Guerrillas because they have better handling and training on weapons and hand to hand combat and have armored weapons and tanks and many more. The KLA only had guns.

I honestly freaked out on a couple of occasions simply because the feeling was too overwhelming but if any of you would like to try it	 the hardest part is just getting it down.

And repeat until all the nutmeg in the glass is gone. If you do it rather early in the day (9-10AM) than by evening you should DEFINITELY feel the effects. Do be careful though!

0	Wikipedia is large	 and there is much to do. I don't recall there being a mandate that editors must chain themselves to particular subjects to the exclusion of everything else. Were such a policy to exist	 I would not have time to entertain your innuendo and criticism tonight. I guess there's a trade-off to everything.
0	Your point about lack of coverage of some of the longer term consequences occurred to me too. I find the trouble with this article is that there is such a vast amount of source material it is hard to get a good overall picture. i think it was Gordon (anyway someone I was reading recently) who made the point that had there been a real battle after Jutland this battle would have been consigned to histories inconsequential near-misses	 just as with the other earlier raids. Gordon's thesis is also very much that failures at Jutland were a consequence  of systemic training failures within the British navy	 which is touched on with the issue of signallling mistakes. I don't know what authors think about the efficiency of the German fleet	 but the overall impression of the British one is poor. Incidentally	 and while on the subject of consequences	 Gordon also made the point that while there may have been deficiencies in British shells	 this was also one of the explanations which Beatty et al. found acceptable to explain his inability to damage the German ships. His bigger difficulty was managing to direct them at anything other than sea. I suspect we are still propagating one of his self-defence red herings.

0	I hate to disagree with you Ran but that is completely incorrect	 the Chinese vernaculars did not start shifting at that time. You can do more research by looking up Middle Chinese and Classical Chinese. The Mandarin never altered the King sound to Jing sound as quickly as that. Most of the colonial invasion came from the Southern Coasts in those days	 thus	 they romanised from Cantonese and Minnan. Kirin is romanised according to the dialect around Jilin at a different stage that is why it is not calle Katlam. By the way	 you are really offensive by blocking me yesterday. You did not read the regulations on Wikipedia that you are not supposed to call users who are newbies Vandals. That is an abuse of your privilege. I notice a lot of experienced editors here who like to block and delete the text contributions of newbies are really mean. Why are educated people so mean? This is a free world and we all have a privilege to speak out part but should also listen to others and not be so quick to censor others.

0	Nishidani	 you raise some good points. The bottom line is that there should not be two lengthy sections in Wikipedia on the same topic	 one an independent article and one a very lengthy section in the SAQ article. As you suggest	 one solution would be to delete the independent article and move the lengthy section in the SAQ article over to replace it. Could we not all have a close look at the two 'historical' accounts to see whether that's feasible	 and then try to reach consensus on that point?

I'm very aware that there are a lot of idiots or militants around on the internet	 and they probably don't know that the laicité concept has since its beginning been openly directed against the catholic church which was thought to be way too much powerful at that time (1905). The law about religious symbols in school	 although badly written (the proposal was to ban *all* religious symbols in primary and secondary schools) is a direct application of this one century-old philosophy as written in the constitution	 so this neologism is just not adequate to describe it. This law that you call the French Hijab ban neither concerns only the Hijab	 nor is a ban of the Hijab in general	 I see Hijab every day when I go back to France. Also the other lies about muslim girls who would not be able to receive an education have now proven to be false	 or very rare.

0	Dear Melca	 I'm glad to see you're back after such long time. I remember we had a similar discussion on the Mohammad Reza Shah talk page	 and I offered you several sources there	 namely two books	 several articles	 and interviews.

0	So a third pornography industry advocate has joined this correspondence	 which increases the number of participants but actually decreases its importance in my affairs	 as well as the relevance of Wikipedia in important matters regarding the health of our society (it is lamentably our society... I only wish I could call it your society).  But I may call Wikipedia your propaganda tool	 since you are apparently the one who has been granted authority to tolerate certain comments which you interpret as being unbiased and to crassly delete other information which you interpret as being biased.  If you really want to avoid bias	 just casually investigate the history of your pornography supporting friend Horrorshow	 who	 not surprisingly	 has been busy editing other articles that clearly promote the pornography industry.  Wikipedia: a free speech tool for the people or a propaganda tool for a certain sector of the population which seeks to control people's opinions on matters that adversely affect their mental health?  Quite a question to ponder.  But my point on bias is that every author is biased.  Just because Wikipedia can be edited by supposedly anybody (in theory it can be	 but in reality it is clearly controlled by certain well-organized individuals who have made Wikipediaing their vocations)	 does not make Wikipedia an unbiased source of information.  The author of this webpage	 who clearly has an interest in displaying information that promotes the pornography industry in the United States	 is biased.  His or her comments on Lubben's religious views clearly betray that sentiment	 as do the history of his or her activities on Wikipedia.  And you don't need to tolerate anything from me any longer	 because I will stop now... or maybe I won't	 I guess it depends on just how much time I'm willing to waste communicating with you.  This is becoming Dostoevskian	 Underground Man... give it a read sometime... it might help you.Veritas	 Semper .  But you and I both know where the truth lies in this matter.  There is no need for an arbitrator	 who	 again	 would be mistakenly be labeled an unbiased third party.

0	The asinine part is not why it's illegal behavior	 it's that when they block you indefinitely	 and when you want to edit	 do they not expect you to evade the block? Why is the length of time you are expected to stay away from sockpuppeting or requesting unblock lengthened if the edits that were made with the sock are good edits? It's that they don't have enough sense to know that if the user is unblocked for making good edits with a sock	 that it is more likely that they will not sockpuppet again	 especially if they did not abuse the sockpuppets when their main account was unblocked. I understand the possibility for the unblocked user to return to the behavior that they were blocked for	 but a community that has Assumption of good faith as a guideline should abide by that guideline. ·t

1	Wow	 you really take this stuff seriously?  Loser!  70.49.241.41
0	Today I made a change to some of the wording in this section	 based on the notion that a right is inherent/inalienable and is thus not something which can be conferred	 rather only acknowledged and protected	 at least when talking about law	 social contracts and a political candidate's position in regard to such matters. In particular	 phrases like Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase	 which was redundant anyway	 and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.

The guy who's never fought	 let alone beat a decent fighter besides Gonzales	 who Jones totally shut out. That makes allot of sense. Regardless. Bernard Hopkins won a light heavyweight title and that's the bottom line. He was the first Middleweight in history to jump to the light heavyweight division and win A title in 1 fight. Something Ray Robinson failed to do. That's a fact and should be included in this biography. Erdei and the lineal title is a JOKE. What good is the stupid title if none of these guys have to defend it against decent competition? You can't hide behind a lame WBO title fighting nobodies and tomato cans and expect to be considered champion. Erdei is a disgrace and so was Michalczewski. That's why Jones embarrassed the guy who beat him.

0	Janbwade: The statements you question are all verified in the body of the article from secondary and primary sources. The primary source is the Watchtower organization itself. If anything	 this source is biased towards itself	 which is understandable. The other sources are diverse and unbiased	 and peer reviewed. Since these secondary sources are reviews of data then bias is not only unlikely	 but virtually impossible. So	 if anything	 we can say none of the sources are hostile toward the Watchtower organization or to the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Hence I fail to see veracity in your complaint.

0	Hello Gerardw. If you click on Forsena's contribution list	 and review the edit summaries	 it is hard to believe that he's patiently seeking consensus on Kosovo matters. (For instance	 Removing data from albanian extermist vandal member Angelo De La Paz). In particular	 look at this edit of Battle of Kosovo where Forsena goes against all the cited references	 and actually *removes* most of them. On the matter of 'disputed country' versus 'disputed region'	 if Angelo continues to make that change without getting consensus first	 it would be worrisome. Though your point about the Balkan topic ban is noted	 since Forsena has not edited any articles since it was announced	 it is too soon to give him credit for following it. The announcement that he was under Digwuren restrictions on 7 January seems to have had no effect at all on his edits. I will leave Angelo a note that his editing was discussed here.

Even if SSCS is lying	 they did say the fact.

The removal of a warning is taken as evidence that the warning has been read by the user. Deleted warnings can still be found in the page history. Repeatedly replacing warnings does nothing but antagonize users	 and can encourage further disruption; removal of template warnings is rarely an urgent or important matter	 and it is often best to simply let the matter rest if other disruption stops.

0	I guess you're referring to Curps when I posted about him in a certain talk page. My apologies; I got a little too excited that minute. Next time I'll better analyze what people tell me before asking for more info about it elsewhere. I hope you don't feel like I've harassed you either; my attempts at communicating with you aren't meant in negative ways.
0	Your absolute disregard of bed-rock rules of Wikipedia and copyright law and of ordinary rules of discourse and courtesy are not merely saddening but actively worrying. Reverting an edit has nothing to do with and says nothing what-so-ever about faithgood or badespecially corrections of mistakes regarding objective and clear-cut criteria. Your leaning upon claims of 'good faith' as a defence against being reverted for doing something that is wrong is not only utterly irrelevant but intellectually dishonest. If you view having your obvious mistakes reverted as some sort of attack upon yourself	 perhaps you should either cease making those mistakes to avoid being disappointed or learn to deal with correction: meaningless claims regarding 'good faith' offers not the slightest immunity from scrutiny nor correction.

0	I think the article reads pretty well. The quotes	 far from being 'turgid'	 are essential for explaining. It's a real relief to read a wiki entry that actually quotes the subject and his critics rather than trying to ineptly summarise them. You're right there are a few repetitions	 but the 'controversy' section certainly is of interest. Indeed	 I notice the Daily Telegraph quoted it in full on Saturday	 suggesting it is of interest to their million or so readers.

Your last sentence seems to say that the taxonomic and population defintions fail to hold but that the lineage definition is fine. Whereas the Britannica article says that races do not exist in any biological sense. It is also incorrect to say  as Britannica does  that genetic indicators cannot divide races  as we've documented in the wikipedia article they can do so approximately. The Britannic article is wrong because it states conclusions that are not supported by the data  it goes too far.  22:55	 Jan 11	 2005 (UTC)

0	The replacement for Mako is most likely Greg Baldwin. He has been a student of Mako's voice since 1977	 and therefore is a great replacement. He has been working with avatar for some time. It is interesting to note that the first time Greg Baldwin speaks in Avatar is in the middle of Iroh's story in 'Tales of Ba Sing Se'	 right after the window was smashed in the earthbending soccer game. If you pay attention	 you can tell that his voice is different from Mako's. The first time Greg Baldwin was credited as Iroh was in the credits of the short 'School Time Shipping'.

0	Dear Amire- help need in getting my first article started- 
0	The question is WHY must I be allowed to edit posthaste rather than	 as the drooling imbecile below instructs me	 to wait it out.  Quite simply	 there are URGENT questions on the Reference Desk that require my immediate attention.  If I don't attend to them now	 I fear that lesser	 misguided and occasionally malicious editors will respond to these questions and give people the WRONG ANSWER.  This may be hard for you to believe	 but I could barely sleep last night worrying about the tidal wave of misinformation that has engulfed the Miscellaneous and Humanities sections of the Reference Desk since I was blocked.  I need to help those poor people NOW.   The reason I was blocked had nothing to do with my sterling and award-winning assistance at the Reference Desk; I was blocked for my naughty (but	 in my view	 entirely warranted) behavior at AN/I.  I have already given you my word that I do not plan to mix it up at the MORONIC incidents board (for at least a couple weeks) but want only to assist my fellow man and impart my wisdom and knowledge at the Reference Desk as well as make minor edits to articles with mistakes them.  It is URGENT.

0	There is no contradiction in those statements at all. The Polynesians who settled New Zealand became the Māori - they are the same people - and the phrase 'the Polynesian ancestors of the Māori' is a common one in NZ scientific literature. The point is that there was no one in New Zealand when the ancestors of the Māori arrived. I like the phrase 'Polynesian ancestors of the Māori'	 but maybe it is confusing to those who haven't heard it before.

I cited your comment above	 you then claimed the additional links I posted came after your comment. You were mistaken as the timeline demonstrates	 you were also wrong ab out the count in the UEFA discussion unless you want to include an argument that was solely about process and didn't address any aspect of the subject's notability or the AfD close itself. You owe me an apology	 but you seem to be too arrogant to realize when you fouled up	 so I can only hope that you will wise up going forward.

0	Yep	 that all makes perfect sense	 and the move is uncontroversial with me and the page's creator	 with whom I discussed this a bit on the Talk page when I made my initial	 ill-fated moves.  Just to clarify what I was after with singular v. plural (so as not to appear a plodding dolt)	 I meant that if we were to push an article toward being about a genre in which works can be referred to in the singular or plural	 the singular seems to be the preferred usage in discussing genre.  A point of general interest: the other	 singular pinakes listed in the Suda entry aren't considered parts of the work known as the Pinakes	 that being Πίνακες τῶν ἐν πάσῃ παιδείᾳ διαλαμψάντων	 καὶ ὧν συνέγραψαν.  I don't know that I believe that interpretation of the testimonia and fragments	 but who am I?  Going this route	 I'd actually be alright with no mention of the/any Pinakes appearing on the Pinax page: this uncited bit about a map picture is a bit too creative for my taste	 considering the other basic meaning and the existence of the πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός at Athens.  Thanks for looking at this and I hope that I can get back to that article soonish and will be thinking about the extra-Callimachean angle that need to be pursued—please let me know if any other names come to mind.

0	Stalin could NEVER have been impersonated!  Through being born within the borders of Russia	 he was not ethnically Russian but Georgian.  (As languages they are completely unrelated.)  His original name was Iosif Dzjugasjvili.  A possible look-alike could not have had	 or even ACQUIRED	 the same language skills!  His family and close friends would NOT be fooled.  The description of “Rashid” is not credible.  The claimed physical resemblance is to close to be true.  Furthermore	 if he died in 1991 at the age of 93 he would have been born in 1898.  That would in turn make him 20 YEARS YOUNGER than Stalin!  Obviously	 the author does not know what he/she is writing about.

0	There's some merit to that. But I think we should wait a bit. This article is being expanded with material for the first time in years and it'd be easier to keep it separate while its being improved. Clearly the LaRouche movment includes many discrete organizations	 many of which have overlapping personnel and aims	 and some of which are notable enough on their own for articles. For example	 the U.S. Labor Party probably deserves an article because every little political party gets an article. OTOH	 the National Democratic Policy Committee	 while in some ways equally important	 probably doesn't merit an article and should be covered in one of the other LaRouche articles. Most of the PACs or campaign comittees are covered in the presidental campaign articles	 but thousands of other candidates also ran under  LaRouche-affilitiated groups. No one ever said this is a simple movement.  ·:·   ·:·

0	Rest assured	 there is nothing incorrect about the posted equations	 I've been using them in this form for more than a decade. The volume units used in the equations is cubic meters.  Since there are 1000 liters in a cubic meter	 you need to multiply by 1000 to convert from cubic meters to liters.  Now if you wanted to use published specs (usually quoted in liters) in the equations provided	 you would divide the Vas(liters) by 1000 to get Vas in cubic meters.  Units can be challenging even for engineers	 it may help to work through a few examples using published specs to get a handle on things.  Drivers from Peerless	 Vifa	 Scan Speak and SEAS tend to have very complete parameter sets that make sense using these equations.  Some manufacturers	 especially car audio companies	 publish specs that are incomplete or inconsistent and will give problems when working through the equations.

Others did tried to do the same thing. So all I got to say is since my edits are 'worth' don't remove them it's a perfect article anyone caught doing it will be reverted straight away.

0	Looks good to me. At the moment	 I don't think we need to mention feral cats - I doubt that it is common for feral cats to enter a house via a cat flap. On the whole cats are uncomfortable with entering another's territory	 although I imagine it does happen occaisionally	 especially if a feral cat learns that there might find food inside. If someone can find a useful reference on the subject we could re-add it. Mind you I did once find a wood pigeon tapping at my girlfriend's cat flap - which seemed particularly unwise.

Both the Su-27 and 30 are Russian. The F-2 and F-CK-1 are Japan/United States and Republic of China/United States co-produced planes. They are representative of American jets	 not planes from Japan or Republic of China (Taiwan). Both the J-10 and Tejas are equipped with foreign engines	 thus not fully indigenous. Even some parts of the Typhoon is subcontracted to the United States. If you wish to remove planes	 then remove all except for American/Russian planes.

Even if he was not notable in March	 he's since been the home run derby winner and the starting first baseman at the FSL all star game. How can a vote held before the season even started be enforced the day after he wins the home run derby? Something about this just doesn't seem right.
0	Thanks	 Delicious Carbuncle. This admission	 however	 is not enough	 in my opinion. I feel that David Shankbone	 real name David C.

0	The fact that Jenny is raped while unconscious during the course of the film shows that Jenny may not be aware of all of the sexual encounters she's had.  She may have been raped before	 and so her claim that she had only ever had sex with Telly may be false (without her even being aware that it's false.)  I always thought that was the whole point of the rape scene — to show that naive beliefs held by these kids can't be trusted.  Telly's belief that he's only ever slept with virgins is probably false (unless he slept with a virgin who had contracted HIV some other way) and so is Jenny's belief that Telly was her only partner	 or that in a culture of random drugged-out sex and casual rape anybody can even be sure who they've slept with.  I've modified the article accordingly.

Unfortunately I do not have a desk at the AMNH museum	 and therefore I cannot get free access to the journals which have the best obituaries of Gordon online	 instead	 each one requires a fee to be paid. And although I know quite a lot about mollusks and malacologists	 I know very little about Crustacea and carcinologists. If something else occurs to me over time	 I will make more contributions to this article. If you want to reply to this	 please do so on my talk page	 thanks. Best to you

For an outline of the actual events see the history of Rome articles. Any reader who comes up with their own original theory on why Rome fell I have a lot of respect for.

Make sure you mention that there has already been a discussion on the talk page (Provide a link to the section so the admin doesn't have to search for it) and that you would like an administrator to review the discussion.  If the admin's or another editor move it out of Uncontroversial moves	 you'll probably have to restart the discussion using the process described on WP:RM.

Granted the athlete has not yet earned a quota for their country means that a quota must be distributed to a different athlete from any country	 as long as the NOC has been entitled to a maximum of two shooters per event. In Kiejko's case	 she is eligible to compete in the 25 m pistol	 but her place must be confirmed by the NOC and ISSF	 along with the quota she won in the 10 m pistol.

0	If you took a history of science course	 you would know that scientists and engineers are continually inventing and refining their research tools and techniques.  Rather than accusing Astrology of being a psuedoscience you should acknowledge Astrology for being the PRE-science that it is.  Emperical observation finds that many (no	 not all) astrological procedures work.  It's not in the job description of us Astrologers to prove that Astrology is a science.  But rather it's within the job description of the physical science researchers to improve the acumen of their research tools so as to discover why Astrology works.

Also	 the chief complaint of that article seems to be that Reeve did not become publicly interested in spinal cord research until after his paralysis.  Apparently the author thinks someone with a disability should just disappear from public view rather than doing something positive.  I'd still like to know why running a disco makes you somehow more of a contributor to mankind than the work Reeve did on behalf of the disabled... and more specifically	 what did Reeve ever do to you?  Did he refuse to sign an autography for you or something?

(Actually since Arabs are Semites	 anti-semitism is directed at them as well) The only thing this proves is that Jews think they're special and exclusive and should get special treatment	 even though many ethno-religious groups have suffered to the same or greater extent	 only the JEWS should get a special name for their type off suffering. Pretentious bastards.
0	Newbie here -) with finger on Oph pulse for going on 25 years; familiar with issues	 history	 etc.; makes this suggestion: for clarity	 the symbol assigned to Ophiuchus on the Zodiac page should be removed.  Here are the reasons: (1) Symbol use gives the impression that Oph is a zodiac sign.  (2) As far as I am aware	 no symbol has officially been decided upon by those who are working with the Oph energy in the context of Astrology.  (I am curious	 just for my own information	 who came up with this symbol and what it represents to him/her/them.)  Thank you.

The 'Old Firm' rivalry was between Celtic FC 1888 and Rangers FC 1872. The Club currently playing at Ibrox is not the Club formed in 1872 so how on earth can the 'Old Firm' term be used as anything other than in the past tense? Would people reporting sightings of Elvios Pressley on the Las Vegas strip 'In Common Speech' be regarded as FACT that he was alive. I rest my case. This example of page hijacking by fans of Rangers FC 1872 has made Wikipedia nothing other than an embarrassment as a source of information.

Secondly	 except for freeware games like Battle for Wesnoth and Galaxy Mage	 I don't see a lot of evidence of Western TRPGs being inspired by Japanese games. When developers do mention their inspiration	 they tend to cite X-COM	 Jagged Alliance or Fallout. The origin of X-COM dates back to Rebelstar and Laser Squad	 earlier games by the same developer that predate the Japanese TRPGs. Thirdly	 it might be more accurate to say that both Eastern and Western TRPGs were partly inspired by the early Ultima games.

But your claims that a published paper in a journal (Complex Systems 19:1	 2010) is not refereed is outrageous and only shows once more the bad faith of the friends of Eppstein and Kieffer to crush by any means whatever or whoever they may dislike. I cannot even discuss the content with you given that you cannot even see that the paper is obviously refereed (obviously you haven't read anything). You even go further saying that everybody has done the same for ages... A very scientific claim I guess.

0	What was wrong with it was really (and you know this) that it was a specific attempt to laugh at the expense of a specific person.  Wikipedia is not an appropriate place to bring your inside jokes	 particularly those that you know to be hurtful to others.

0	Merge is now complete. I removed a section recently added about the content of a current issue	 leaving in the text and references about the magazine itself. -
0	If that is the case	 then share the source. Scan the information	 bring up the census. Otherwise it's not true. If you do that	 you will see that you are wrong	 just like you were wrong in the central bosnia canton. And then you will probably continue attacking me for fixing your mistakes. I have census	 and my results show something different. On top of this all	 nobody makes a map according to districts	 but according to srez or whatever it was called back then. There were about 30-40 units in Bosnia back then	 not 6. (  ).
0	I know	 I understood that. )  I didn't scold you for it at all	 did I make you feel that way?

0	I propose that the article could be updated each day should any editor be so inclined and as long as the information is verifiable.  That's what Wikipedia is: a source of information that -upon occasion- acts as an almanac.  But I'm not going to do it...I'm not that invested.  But if somebody else is	 God bless their efforts.207.237.230.18

0	I've looked in my Dutch sources	 but found no mention of it... In 1988 the Giro was not yet considered important enough for Dutch readers. I found another noteworthy thing however: the route of the eighth stage of 1989 was changed because American president George H. W. Bush  was visiting Rome.

Anyways	 do not try to convince these people of the truth - as you say	 the mistake is there	 hopefully it can be fixed before release	 but the one that played this weekend in LA	 last week in NYC	 and in Australia and Korea mistakenly calls the tank Devastator.  This is only in a subtitle not verbal.  Anyways	 don't let the name callers here upset you.

0	I think we agree it is quite obvious that Sony sent out Dev-Kits back in 2012. But back then it was a rumor	 and that is also the basis of the article you linked. Stick to the rules	 don't treat it as a fact until you have a proper reference. 
1	What gives you the authority to talk like that? Gosh	 aren't you toilet-trained?
0	Which one? As far as I can see both of your current articles are still there but I have tagged National Association Of Farmers to be deleted because it doesn't make much sense	 has no references and it is not clear how big or important the organisation is. I can't delete anything myself	 as I am not an administrator	 so it will only be deleted if an administrator agrees that it should be. Special Real State Agent was deleted by somebody else. I never even saw that one.
0	Rubbish - stop worrying about it. Your edits are worthwhile and needed. Your East Hills article is excellent. Keep going and stop giving up every time people don't agree with you.

0	Automatic protection for Main Page? It would be straightforward to write a bot that (1) protected all images on the main page	 adding Template:Mprotected	 and (2) unprotected all images with Template:Mprotected that no longer appeared on the main page. Feature (2) would be genuinely useful and save editors work. However	 if editors came to rely on feature (1) then that would introduce a risk	 because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it. A clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap. And worse	 the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image. I suppose the bot could attempt to detect vandalism like that but you can see how complex the process could become.  08:13	 2005 May 13 (UTC)

0	Where I worked at everyone was paid minimum wage.  Those of you who worked at those other stores are lucky.  No one at our store ever got a raise unless you became a manager or crew leader.  Even people who had worked there for over a year were given raises. Then again our store owner was a dick.  In a fit of rage he threw a cheddar burger through the window and hit a woman who worked the bun station. Bob Messenger had to come into the store before because of the owner's behavior.  Hostile work environment much?

0	Actually	 a lot of anthropologists would dispute that there are racial gaps in IQ	 not least because (as people who actually study the subject of 'race'	 rather than just making generalisations about it)	 they are aware that 'race' is a complex social construct	 rather that a simplistic biological 'fact'. Actually	 I suspect many would argue that the same can be said for 'intelligence' too.
